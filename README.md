- A functionality that persists cart items using local storage, so users can still find their items in the cart after they close the browser and return.
- While the website currently lacks a checkout functionality, it demonstrates the front-end development skills I have honed. I hope this project offers a glance into my capabilities in front-end development. <br><br>
